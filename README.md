# A simple script to check reddit
Just a basic ruby script to check the top 10 posts in any sub reddit and get instantly taken to any of those posts.  
  
## To Do:  
- Offer a new search instead of terminating out
- Offer more/less than 10 posts
- Maybe turn into a true command line tool instead of a basic ruby script
- Anything else that adds value  
  
### For fun:  
Alias 'ruby <location of script on your computer>' to something like 'check_reddit' in your bash_profile.
